How to recognize if you are over studying and learn effectively.

## Why does Over Studying Occur?
Some students tend to over study when they go from junior high to high school.  This can also happen when a student goes from high school to college. Suddenly, a student finds that everyone is just as good if not better than him or her at studies. The student studies harder using methods that worked before but instead he keeps falling behind. He loses confidence in his ability.
 
## Over Studying and Grades
It is true that getting good grades needs you to put in time and effort. However, you may find that even if you put in a lot of time and effort, your grades do not improve, instead they may get worse. You then put in even more time and effort. You study harder and longer but your grades keep dropping. The more you study the worse things become.  This is a sign you are probably overstudying. 

## Common Signs of Over Studying
How would know if you are over studying? If you ou put in the effort but don't see improvement in your grades, look for the signs of overstudying below:
1. Unable to pay attention in class and retain new information
1. Withdrawing from Social activity: Having less interaction with others
1. Lack of Sleep: too little hours or sleep is restless
1. Feeling Irritated
1. Headaches and stomach aches

## How to Study Effectively
1. Write in down  
  Pay attention in class. Jot down important points. Underline and highlight important points. Make notes. 
1. Talk in out  
  Ask questions in class if you donâ€™t understand and clear your doubts as soon as possible. Discuss with classmates. 
1. Practise with small steps  
  Learn enough to self-correct by solving problems.  Start with easy problems first. Gain confidence. Then try harder problems. If you can't solve the whole problem, break down the problem into smaller parts and solve some of the smaller parts.
1. Teach it.  
  The best way to test if you have understood something is to try to teach it. Refine your notes. Sketch diagrams. Make it fun.  If no one is willing to listen, try to teach your dog. ( It works. My dog was very good at physics after listening to many of my Physics lessons and I became a Physics teacher)

## Combine Effective Study with a balanced Life
Even if you use the above study method, you still need to ensure that you get enough rest . Take a 5-minute break after each 20 minutes of study. If you find that you are not understanding the content, switch to studying a different subject for the next 20 minutes. Get at least 8 hours of sleep and 30 minutes of exercise daily.  Take time to eat meals slowly. Taste the food, enjoy eating.

## Taking Things in Perspective
Remember that while tests and academic grades are important, they are not everything. How you do in a job interview depends a lot on how you speak and put forth your views. Grades matter but they are only one component to a successful life. Ten years from now no one except you will remember your grades. Perhaps not even you.
