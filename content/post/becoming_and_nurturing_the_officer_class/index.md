Some people have the attributes that we admire and strive to get. Who are these people, what are these attributes and how can we achieve them?

##  What is the Officer Class ( Brief history)
Twenty years ago I coined the term “Officer Class” as a certain category to better understand  this group of people. I wanted to learn about them as much as possible because I wanted to be in this group. I wanted not only to excel in this group but also to help and nurture others.

## Who belongs to the Officer Class
30 Vs 70
From my observations, only a minority of people belong to the Officer Class. Perhaps 30%.
Are you in this class?
If your answer is “yes”, congratulations. People who are reading this article are very likely to be in the Officer Class.
 
## How did you or how does one get into the Officer Class
1. Higher education or skills
The passport to the Officer Class is attaining a higher education. For example, a college graduate. Or if you have a skill that is highly regarded. For example, you are a craftsman.

2. Privileged Background
Exposure or taught Officer Class values and attributes during your childhood.
These include: born into an Officer Class family, attended an Officer Class school or lived in an Officer Class neighbourhood.

 3. Leadership Opportunity
  Promotion to lead a team at work
  Eldest child

4. Challenging Family Background
Children who experienced poverty, loss of parent(s) or discrimination etc and who have overcomed them have obtained or paracticed many Officer Class attributes.

## Officer Class Attributes and how to achieve and nurture them.
Many in the Officer Class demonstrate the following characteristics and teach them to their children. 

1. Noble Aspirations: justice, fairness, “help save the world”, “make the world a better place” 
Officer Class children are taught, not only right from wrong but whether they can do better. To take  the higher moral ground if given a choice.

2. Independence: Independent worker, thinker, learner
They start being independent as young as possible and remain independent as long as they can. Many independent elderly in their eighties and nineties belong to the Officer Class.  Their children are encouraged to take care of themselves. Many are given the opportunity to leave home and study abroad. Many immigrants demonstrate this “immigrant mentality” and are highly successful.

3. Responsible
The Officer Class accept responsibility for their own decisions and actions. They take the initiative to lead. They take on new responsibilities and are willing to take on the responsibility of others. They demonstrate being “the stronger links in a chain” and encourage their children to help others, to give more and take less. 

4. Wide World View:  The Officer Class are lifelong learners.  They have a wide world view and are able to see inside and outside the box. They expose their children to people from different places, backgrounds, cultures and many different experiences.
Travel, reading and discussion are common activities. Children are encouraged to question and seek different points of view.

 5.  Confidence:
The Officer Class do not appear to be bothered by peer pressure. They do not follow rules/norms without question or understanding. They are comfortable in many situations and can communicate on many levels and with people from different backgrounds.  They are interesting and have their own views. They share and encourage interests, hobbies with their children and give them the opportunity to attend many enrichment classes.

6. Excellence: The Officer Class strive to do a good job. They are not clock watchers. They will walk the extra mile to come up with suggestions or solutions after evaluation. They teach their children to not just be reporters or a postmans but to be creative problem solvers. They demonstrate building a portfolio of work based on successes and lessons learned from mistakes.  

7. Gracious ( An Officer and a Gentleman)
The Officer Class are well mannered in action and speech. They show respect and consideration for others. Their children are taught to follow the spirit of the law and not the letter of the law and to give others the benefit of doubt.

Being an Officer is not something that is static. We can lose it if we do not practise the attributes of the Officer Class. It is something that we hone and aspire towards. It is our responsibility to teach these attributes to the next generation.  I wish everyone all the very best in their  journey as an Officer and hope that one day the majority of people belong to this Officer Class.
