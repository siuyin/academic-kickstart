Beyond Broadcast's Principal Engineer, Loh Siu Yin was commissioned by TSL Systems to configure a broadcast monitoring system for a major broadcaster in Singapore.

Nagios software provided core monitoring capabilities while Siu Yin wrote custom integration scripts to complete the configuration.  
Monitoring -- "What has gone wrong" and more importantly "What is predicted to fail" is becoming increasingly more important with complex broadcast systems.

Besides nagios, Beyond Broadcast can also configure systems based on Prometheus monitoring with Grafana visualisation and log-aggregation and analytics with the Elastic Stack.
