In the analog domain we had colour bars. Mathematics gives you Mean-Squared Error and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio.

Netfilx and Machine Learning introduces VMAF (Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion) which is a "perceptual video quality assessment algorithm".

Soon software robots will be running the broadcast QC station.
