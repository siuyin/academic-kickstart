Problem: I could share my whiteboard, other meeting participants could view the whiteboard but could not write to it.

Here is how to enable meeting a participant's write access.
1. Ask the meeting participant to mouse over the top of the zoom window to show "View Options".
1. Ask them to click on their "View Options" and select "Annotate"
1. An annotation toolbar should now appear on their screens. They can use this to annotate the whiteboard you are sharing.

After the meeting, I, the member _initiating_ the whiteboard share can save the board to a file and send out the file via email.
