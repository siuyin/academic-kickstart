1. Write it down.  
   Write down what you want to accomplish in one short and clear sentence. One sentence and not a paragraph.

2. Share and discuss.  
   Share your goal with your team and consider their views.

3. Take a small step, review and repeat.  
   Implement and accomplish a small part of your goal, measure and check if it is in the right direction. Revise your written goal as needed and repeat the process.
