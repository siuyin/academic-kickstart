Have we misunderstood the significance of looking at that half glass of water? Is it always better to see the glass as half full as compared to half empty? What and how can we benefit if we see things from the half empty glass perspective?

## That famous half glass of water
Scenario: There is half a glass of water on the table.
Question: What do you see?
Answer 1: A glass that is half full of water.
Answer 2: A glass that is half empty

## Half empty vs half full
As a child I was told that if you saw the glass as half full of water, then you are an optimistic person. If you saw the glass as half empty then you are a pessimistic person. Those who saw the half empty glass are told to see things from the view of the half full glass of water. 

## Should we always view that glass as being half full of water
Like many of those who saw the glass as half full, I was very pleased and grateful to have a happy life. In fact, as long as there is water in the glass, I felt that I was lucky. In my teens I began to feel that the world was not fair. I would ask myself questions like: Why was I so lucky when there are others who are not lucky? What if my luck runs out?  To answer these questions I decided to look at things from the opposite perspective.

## What if we see the glass as half empty? 
Is this empty space useful? If we see the glass as half empty, we see that we can fill it with more water. In fact, the more empty space there is in the glass, the more water we can add.
 
Life Lessons: The empty space in the glass shows us that all of us have room for growth and  improvement. There is so much in life to learn and experience. We should not just be happy to sit still and let life pass us by. Instead we need to look around for things to inspire us and work towards becoming better persons.

## How much water do we need?
What happens if we add water into the glass? The water will eventually reach the brim and soon any additional water added will spill over. There is only so much water that the glass can contain.

Life Lessons: To lead a happy life we only need a certain amount. To some this means 3 meals a day and a bed to sleep at night. To some others, it means satisfying three urgent needs: able to eat, to eliminate and to sleep. In fact some Chinese who wish to be excused and go to the toilet will say, “ I need to attend to an urgent need.” We can only fill our lives with so much stuff. Also the more stuff we have does not necessarily lead to a happier life. It could even make us unhappy. Keep life simple. Know what you want and what you need.
