sched and sched-v12 are a pair of programs to create a broadcast schedule.

sched works with a user defined database and a spreadsheet to create a schedule.

sched-v12 translates the schedule into an automation-ready playlist targeting Image Communications (formerly Harris) ADC automation v12 playlist format.
