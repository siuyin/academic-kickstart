Live IP Video was a hot topic for NAB2016. ASPEN was first but AIMS seems to be gaining dominance.

4K UHD (Ultra HD) is gaining traction and 12G SDI now seems a viable contender to IP.

HDR (High Dynamic Range) was all the rage with competing standards ST 2028 and HLG (Hybrid Log Gamma) competing.

Tico, a lightweight compression technology to fit 4K into 10G gained ground. However VC2, a competing standard appeared in NAB2016.

Virtual Reality 360 still going strong but I believe it is a fad -- much like 3D.

Finally Cloud Services (Playout, MAM and Transcoding) is an idea whose time has come.
