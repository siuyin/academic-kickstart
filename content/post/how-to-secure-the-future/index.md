How do we keep ourselves independent (productive and relevant economically and socially) for as long as possible?

## Future trends and challenges  
1. Increase in population : world population is now 7 billion and is predicted to increase. More competition for jobs
1. Longer life expectancy: Life expectancy increasing from 70 to 80 years. More years when we are not working.
1. Technological disruptions:. More and more jobs done by computers, machines and robots. Loss of traditional jobs and creation of new jobs that change fast.
1. Autonomy shifting from humans to AI: More and more reliance on computers and data to recommend solutions to our questions and hence affect our decisions.

## Questions needed
We need to have a clear understanding of ourselves. What is relevant and important to us? 
What can influence and manipulate us? How can we adapt quickly to a rapidly changing and competitive world? How can we adapt during a long life span?

 ## Traps that can hinder us.
1. Learned helplessness
1. Bubbles  and Echo Chambers: Teenagers who see the world as black and white are very susceptible. It often starts as a bubble: A bubble occurs when people inside are not exposed to others outside. Soon even if they have lines of communication with the rest of the world, the people inside the bubble may become more resistant to the outside voices. They distrust the standard sources and their trust is redirected and concentrated inside the echo chamber. 
 

## Skills, knowledge and practices needed include:
1. Life long learning
1. Computer/digital literacy
1. Ethics and Philosophy
1. Emotional intelligence
1. Mental strength and flexibility
1. Social Intelligence
1. Wide breadth of disciplines and experiences
1. Personal autonomy and authority
1. Financial savvy and thrift
1. Compassion
 
## How do we achieve them?
1. Putting learning to practice
1. Helping others
1. Practising responsibility and Personal accountability
1. Exposure to a wide range of people, ideas, cultures, disciplines and experiences
1. Increasing your social circle

## When do we start?
We need to start now. Children should be given increasing opportunities to help others and think objectively. Everyone should practise this as long as they can.
